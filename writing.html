                        <span class="writing-entry-meta">Kyle Libra · January 23, 2026</span>
                        <p>This piece dismantles the myth of the “eureka moment” and reveals the surprisingly formulaic origins behind companies like Uber, Slack, and Airbnb. It includes two practical frameworks for evaluating startup ideas — one lightweight for side projects, one battle-tested at a venture studio — making it a useful read for anyone sitting on a list of half-baked ideas wondering which one to pursue.</p>

                        <p>Fintech platforms and legacy banks are locked in a $300B race to become the “everything bank” through tokenization. The battlefield? Stablecoins. The stakes? 54% of JPMorgan’s quarterly revenue. Here’s what you need to know if you’re building in the crossfire.</p>

                        <p>Circle and Tether haven’t won—they’ve commoditized themselves. Here’s why the real opportunity for founders is in distribution and infrastructure, not issuance.</p>

                        <span class="writing-entry-meta">Wintermute · February 26, 2026</span>
                        <p>Wintermute’s data-driven analysis of how retail capital flows between crypto and equities have fundamentally shifted. As crypto volatility compresses with institutional ETF adoption, retail traders are increasingly treating stocks and digital assets as direct substitutes rather than correlated risk-on bets — with major implications for what drives the next crypto cycle.</p>

                        <span class="writing-entry-meta">Meltem Demirors · February 24, 2026</span>
                        <p>A sharp-eyed take on what institutional adoption of crypto actually looks like in practice. Demirors argues that institutions aren’t here to participate in the crypto economy — they’re here to turn it into a fee stream for their AUM machines. A useful counterweight to the uncritical “institutions are coming” narrative.</p>

                        <p>A deep, accessible breakdown of how perpetual futures work in crypto — the dominant trading instrument most people outside the industry have never heard of. McKenzie explains the mechanics, the funding rate system that keeps perps tethered to spot prices, and why a plurality of all stablecoins exist to collateralize these positions.</p>
